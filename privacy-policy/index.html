                <br><br>
                This website does not collect any personal identity data from its users. However, this website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may do so.
                Provided below is a link to the privacy policy information of GitHub Pages:<br><br>

                This privacy policy applies to the apps and games (hereby referred to as "Applications") created by Potatoful Games (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial service.
                This service is intended for use "AS IS".
                <br><br><br>
                Information Obtained by the Applications and How It Is Used:<br><br>
                The Applications themselves do not obtain any information when you download and use them. Registration is not required to use the Applications.
                However, our Applications do use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you and they may require registration.
                We want to inform users of the Applications that these third parties may have access to their Personal Information.
                The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.<br><br>
                We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
                <br><br>
                    <li>To facilitate our Applications;</li>
                <br>
                    <li>To provide the Applications on our behalf;</li>
                <br>
                    <li>To perform Application-related services; or</li>
                <br>
                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Applications are used.</li>
                <br><br>

                Your Opt-Out Rights:<br><br>
                You can stop all collection of information by the Applications easily by uninstalling them.
                You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your device or via the Applications' marketplaces or networks.

                Security:<br><br>
                The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information.
                However, since the Applications do not collect any information, there is minimal risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.
                <br><br><br>
                Links to Other Sites:<br><br>
                The Applications may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
                Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
                We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

                The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Applications and/or Services.
                The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Applications and/or Services without their permission.
                If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Applications and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (<a href="mailto:contact@potatofulgames.com" title="Potatoful Games Contact Email">contact@potatofulgames.com</a>) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.
                You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

                Changes to This Privacy Policy:<br><br>
                This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.

                You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
                <br><br>
